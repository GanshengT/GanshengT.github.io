The central pattern generator plays an important role in motor execution. 
I am fascinated by the involvement of rhythm in central nervous system processing, for example, Neuronal oscillation, heart beat, respiration, 
motor neuron patterned firing. The question is: can we modulate the rhythmic dynamic to enhance coordination and improve rehabilitation from neurological disorder, hemiparesis for example?

Future work
-----------
more refinement can be done on the discretizing steps

Special thank to Hugues Talbot





Challenges 
---------
* almost-continue discretising step for stereo image to find visual correspodance
