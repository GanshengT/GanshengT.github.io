# Background
Years ago, I made a claim that the world is running in a irrational way. I was 95% wrong. I want to updated my thoughts to this point as I have been dwelling in the field of medecine and neuroscience for 4 years.
We, humans, perceive nature through senses and cognition. I define cognition as the ability of reasoning, abstraction, and communication (information transferring). Scientifically, at least based on the literature to date, cognition is grounded on our sensation. For example, we like to make visual analogy to explain a concept, sphere-atom, river-time, let along numerous 2D illustrations in scientific publications.

# The flaw
One reason behind my previous claim is my assertation that optimality exists and that the world should function 'optimally'. In other words, entities that exist in the world should evolve and converge to a state that is optimal for its existance. I still believe that is one of the universal law. However, I believe my definition of irrational stems from my incomplete understanding of the nature. I previously deemed 'human argues with lound voice' and 'medicine is developed for reduce symdrome but not the cause'. Although these phenomena seems irrational when looking at their immediate consequences, lound voice hurt the throat and reducing syndrome tricks the body's alarm system that is supposed to limit acvities that might aggregrate the syndrome. The flaw of the reasoning lie in my subjective definition of optimality. When thinking in the conext of society, human is predetermined to pursue for happiness (take a look at Robert M. Sapolsky, 'Determined: A Science of Life without Free Will', I agree with this opinion but I am also trying to find the link between stochanisticities and free will to disprove it.). Therefore, a medicine that reduces the pain and agonst will bring about fortune, accelerating the flow of currency, which accelerated the cycle of working hard, paying for rent and health care to compensate for the consequences of working hard. This seamingly contradicting and irrational cycle is bringing human motivation to work and produce values. although we might realize and complain about this fact, we continue to work to the detrimental degree.

# Alternatives in an individual standpoint
Rationality is context dependent and is a subjective doctrine. I wanted to name this section solution at the begining. That proves how subjective I am when judging the way the world works. Built upon a simplitic philosophy, I inherently tend to think the mismatch between action and goal is irrational. Therefore, I feel obliged to provide solutions. But they are just alternatives.


The world is functioning in its own way. Regardless whether there is an universal law determining its trajectory, I propose the following alternative in an individual standpoint for people felt the controversies and irrationality: Being modest. At the begining of my PhDs, I curated knowledge to a point that I felt I understood what is supposed to be in this world. This arrogancy leads to disappointment in the practical life. As I dived deeper into human behavior and how human brain works to perceive and make sense of the world, I realized the multiple layers of explanation. For example, to explain a behavior, say, false memory, we could either think from a psychological viewpoint that association between memory and retrival are modifiable, or from a neuroscience viewpoint, that connection between neurons has been potentiated by  chenical agent in the extracellular space, or from a computational view point that the brain dynamically assigns hash code/pointer to information in the storage space. Thinking across subjects is the first step of being modest. The core of being modest is to realize that human cognition is bound by our sensation and physical properties. These explaintion is not the whole picture. They are proposed as they can be transferred / communicated more easily. Therefore, acknowding the level of explanation and seeking to discovering the universal law is an alternative. Even the universal law is not there, this process of seeking is a first step to map the condition for which a law holds true.

# Goal of living: Naturalistic existence vs technological interventions

Humans have dreamed for immortality. Modern medicine offers solutions—from knee replacements to more sophisticated biomedical implants. In East Asian traditions, longevity is revered, and we are taught to cherish life as precious. From a societal standpoint, though, many believe in living, at least in part, to contribute to the nation or broader community. While such beliefs can be seen as limiting individual will, they also imbue our efforts with a sense of purpose and fulfillment. In the contrast, I believe living is more about accumulating experiences: if technology helps extend our lifespan, then it arguably enables more opportunities to explore the world and grow personally. 

Determining what is “right” in one’s personal pursuit is difficult. Motivations are shaped by a unique interplay of genetics, environment, and cultural values. For example, I find meaning in revealing nature’s mysteries, thereby deepening our collective knowledge.

I an era increasingly shaped by technology, we must examine how emerging tools might alter this pursuit of knowledge. Large Language Models, for instance, have undeniably boosted my own productivity, granting me a temporary sense of superiority. However, as I’ve seen peers accept questionable conclusions produced by these AI systems, I’ve grown cautious ( whether equal sample sizes are required in ANOVA, maybe it is still the case when you search in google). LLMs generate content based on probabilistic mappings of existing data; if over-relied upon, they stifle the creation of genuinely novel ideas. Without new human insights feeding into them, LLMs risk hitting a plateau, an eventual standstill where neither algorithmic nor human innovation truly evolves.

I have witnessed LLM-generated results so fundamentally flawed that they risk misleading researchers who are unaware of the subtle complexities involved.

# Advocate for a format of explanation: mathematics

Vision is one of human’s sensation, is also one limitation. We tend to transform information in a spatial representation, thereby limiting our knowledge to things that are transformable. To overcome this, we can finding a more generalized way for transforming concept to spatial representation, the mapping between digitalized information and a image (2D matrix). Unfortunately, as far as I know, not every function is isomorphic to the R^2 space (image). I adovocate starting to consider generalization representation format, which usually takes the format of symbols and stems from the set theory.
