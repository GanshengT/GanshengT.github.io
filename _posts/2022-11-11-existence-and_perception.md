# Prelude
We perceive the world through vision, sensation, sound, smell, taste. Mechanistically, the receptor of the cells senses the environment and transduce the signals/molecules/electrical activities to the brain. A fundamental problem of defining existence in the world is: how do we define the existence that can not beb sensed. I find a less intimidating way to formulate the question: if the signal from cell receptor takes a certain period to reach our brain, can we tell if the stimuli occurs at the present time.

Before diving into the existence and sensation, we need to see the necessity of addressing them because thinking is metabolically costy. We human know what we can feel, but we can't really tell if there is existence outside our senses. My friend P and I are holding different opinions on how should we perceive the world. And our views might be the two mainstream attitude towards this question. P likes to think like a naturalist, thinking nature exists before human has mind. So all human intelligence leads to the discovery of nature. I prefer to think nature exists only if we can perceive it. Tat being said, human knowledge is built on several key principles, and the accumulation of knowledge produce nature. People might wonder how we can be sure about human knowledge is true. In my point of view, we don't know. Neither can we be sure ablut the existence of the truth. Therefore, human only correct their knowledge when they found contradiction, for xample, the difference betwwen prediction from theory and our senses, which is what is happinging now in the advancement of science.

As I look deeper into the mechanism of our nervous system, I become more prone to the idea that all the findings are based on our senses. If the nature intentially hides certain facts from our brain by biologically manipulate our senses, can we find out the truth? For example, the neuronal morphology is studied by looking at the imaging pictures. I keep asking myself can we prove the existence that can not be sensed even thought all our knowledge is verified by our senses. We human make many instruments as intermediate tools of research, electrodes, microscope for example. Can instrument increase the dimension of our sense? All is there a bug in the hiding system that can be a breakthrough if we cross validate our senses.

By addressing the relationship between human perception and existence, we would know how to communicate findings more efficiency as a researcher. More importantly, we might be able to justify the way our knowledge is gained. Eventually, we could find a way to describe an existence that is hidden from our senses.

# Does instrument provide additional information?
An instrument is usually considered as a device that translates signals to sensible signals. 

# What is the sixth sense?
Deduction, thinking, prediction, memory are higher cognitive functions that guide our behavior befond the simple reflex from stimuli. New knowledge is formed through reasoning contemplating. Note that the rules of discovery, validation, or propagation of new knowledge have been taught since we had memory and interacted with the environment. The fundamental question is that: Is the principle of knowledge accumulation restricted by our senses?
