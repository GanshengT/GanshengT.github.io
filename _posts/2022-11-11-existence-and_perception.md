# Prelude
We perceive the world through vision, sensation, sound, smell, taste. Mechanistically, the receptor of the cells senses the environment and transduce the signals/molecules/electrical activities to the brain. A fundamental problem of defining existence in the world is: how do we define the existence that can not beb sensed. I find a less intimidating way to formulate the question: if the signal from cell receptor takes a certain period to reach our brain, can we tell if the stimuli occurs at the present time.

Before diving into the existence and sensation, we need to see the necessity of addressing them because thinking is metabolically costy. We human know what we can feel, but we can't really tell if there is existence outside our senses. My friend P and I are holding different opinions on how should we perceive the world. And our views might be the two mainstream attitude towards this question. P likes to think like a naturalist, thinking nature exists before human has mind. So all human intelligence leads to the discovery of nature. I prefer to think nature exists only if we can perceive it. Tat being said, human knowledge is built on several key principles, and the accumulation of knowledge produce nature. People might wonder how we can be sure about human knowledge is true. In my point of view, we don't know. Neither can we be sure ablut the existence of the truth.
