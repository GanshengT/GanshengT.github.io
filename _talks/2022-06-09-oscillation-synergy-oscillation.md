M.S. Tan talk about the interaction between cortical oscillation and muscle synergies (OSI) in healthy individuals and hemiparesis patients. M.S. Tan found OSI were 5 muscle synergies during the rectangular movement  of the upper limb including push, horizontal abduction, pull, and horizontal addction. These muscle synergies were modulates by the cortical oscillation. OSI is an index of motor function in hemiparesis patients and provide insignts in developing effective neuromodulatory therapies.
