## Objective:
I am a self-motivated and team-minded Ph.D. student with 6 years of experience in **neuromodulation research** and bioelectrical signal processing. I seek to understand neural plasticity through electrophysiology, interact with these signals using an interdisciplinary approach, and develop new effective treatments for nervous system-related diseases.
