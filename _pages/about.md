Introduction
============

Currently I'm a student of engineering at [Centrale Paris](https://www.centralesupelec.fr/) as well as a researcher in [L2S: Laboratoire des signaux et syst√®me](http://www.l2s.centralesupelec.fr/). These days I mostly analyse EEG(Electroencephalography) signal during meditation focusing on several fields such as *personal artifacts detection* and *relaxation degree classification*.

Project list
============

feel free to contact me if you are interested in one of the following projects
-[] artificial blood, the goal is to find the red blood cell substitutes 
-[] Language prouction research concerning ERP(Event-Related Potential), EEG or MEG(Magnetoencephalography). The main purpose is to create speech by using brain signals. (partly achieved thanks to AI)
-[x] Relevant feature engineering for EEG signals during meditation
