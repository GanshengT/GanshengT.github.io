Introduction
============

Currently I'm a student of engineering at [Centrale Paris](https://www.centralesupelec.fr/) as well as a researcher in [L2S: Laboratoire des signaux et syst√®me](http://www.l2s.centralesupelec.fr/). These days I mostly analyse EEG(Electroencephalography) signal during meditation focusing on several fields such as *personal artifacts detection* and *relaxation degree classification*.
