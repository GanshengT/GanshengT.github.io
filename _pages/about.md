Gansheng TAN was a techinicien at [INSERM U1028 Centre de Recherche en Neurosciences de Lyon](https://sfrsantelyonest.univ-lyon1.fr/centre51-inserm-u1028-cnrs-umr5292.html) as well as a research scientist in [L2S: Laboratoire des signaux et système](http://www.l2s.centralesupelec.fr/) whose research spans a cross-section of engineering, data science, and neuroscience. 

Academic Research
=================
Gansheng TAN is creative and ingenious, with high sense of responsability. He showed great interest in information domain and was rewarded second place of national computer performing competition when he was at high-school. He received his B.S. from [ShangHai Jiao Tong University](http://en.sjtu.edu.cn/) and engineering degree (equivalent to Master degree) at [Centrale Paris](https://www.centralesupelec.fr/). During first two years in mechanical department of ShangHai Jiao Tong University, Gansheng has evaluated water film flow on large vertical and inclined flat plate of the passive containment cooling system (PCCS). In the field of machine learning and information, he has contributed to the creation of the website [La Condamine](https://lacondamine.org/), the CANs(Creative Adversarial Networks) as well as several information propagation models. Gansheng worked on the analysis of EEG(Electroencephalography) signal during meditation focusing on several fields such as **personal artifacts detection** and **relaxation degree classification** since 2018. He came up with semi-automatic EEG preprocessing pipeline that is widely used by reseach teams in INSERM. Gansheng started study of mechnical engineerinig master degree in Robotic Institute of Shanghai Jiao Tong University, and currently deal with graph-based functional analysis of multi-channels EEG-EMG signals and its application in sport performance assessment as well as stroke rehabilittion.

Project list
============

Feel free to contact Gansheng TAN by email if you are interested in one of the following projects
- [ ] artificial blood, the goal is to find the red blood cell substitutes 
- [X] biological and medical image restortion and reinforcement by minimizing the multi-layer graph-based energy function
- [ ] Language prouction research concerning ERP(Event-Related Potential), EEG or MEG(Magnetoencephalography). The main purpose is to create speech by using brain signals. (partly achieved thanks to AI)
- [X] Relevant feature engineering for EEG signals during meditation, TBR (theta-beta ratop) and PAC (phase amplitute coupling) prove disctinct between meditation expects and beginners in FA (focus attention) meditation.
- [ ] Computational bijection mapping between visual image (Visual Spatial Attention) and [retinotopy](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/retinotopy)
- [ ] stroke evaluation and intervention: the application of convolutional neural network on EEG-EMG functional connectivity graph 

Philosophy
==========
Gansheng TAN believes that
- One can always make his or her current decision the best one when he or she review it in the future.
- The imperfait memory and learning ability is the best resource of motivation.

Other activities
================
Believing an open exchange of ideas accelerates scientific progress towards solving our most persistent problems. Gansheng TAN participate in a science project **Open Science**, the goal of which is to promote a open science platform (_COS_)[https://cos.io/] and a new publishing register pipeline. Gansheng TAN is gathering a voluntary team in the purpose of analyzing biological data of stroke patient and explaining the validity of various therapy (e.g. TMS)<br><br>



Gansheng TAN is doing a social projet **Tandem** which aims to provide a platform and give those of commun interest or seeking a new skill an oppotunity to help each other. Gansheng also do an teaching assistantship on *Analysis, probability and Partial Differential Equation* at CentraleSupelec.Gansheng Tan also contributed to R-packages such as *eeglab* and *eegkits*. <br><br>
Gansheng TAN is an amateur musician, he played guitar when he started the high school, and he praticed trombone when he was in [La band'à joe](http://www.bandajoe.com/?page=accueil_accueil). He created a band *Aegean without sea* at CentraleSupélec and had several performing at school festivial and at Univercité Paris Sud. In addition, Gansheng TAN often plays often basketball, he plays for SJTU in [FCBA](http://w35-associations.apps.paris.fr/searchasso/jsp/site/Portal.jsp?page=searchasso&id=3639)
