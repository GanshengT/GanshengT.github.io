Gansheng TAN is a techinicien at [INSERM U1028 Centre de Recherche en Neurosciences de Lyon](https://sfrsantelyonest.univ-lyon1.fr/centre51-inserm-u1028-cnrs-umr5292.html) as well as a research scientist in [L2S: Laboratoire des signaux et système](http://www.l2s.centralesupelec.fr/) whose research spans a cross-section of engineering, data science, and neuroscience. 

Academic Research
=================
Gansheng TAN is creative and ingenious, with high sense of responsability. He showed great interest in information domain and was rewarded second place of national computer performing competition when he was at high-school. He received his B.S. from [ShangHai Jiao Tong University](http://en.sjtu.edu.cn/) and became engineering student at [Centrale Paris](https://www.centralesupelec.fr/). During first two years in mechanical department of ShangHai Jiao Tong University, Gansheng has evaluated water film flow on large vertical and inclined flat plate of the passive containment cooling system (PCCS). In the field of machine learning and information, he has contributed to the creation of the website [La Condamine](https://lacondamine.org/), the CANs(Creative Adversarial Networks) as well as several information propagation models. Currently Gansheng worked on the analysis of EEG(Electroencephalography) signal during meditation focusing on several fields such as **personal artifacts detection** and **relaxation degree classification**.

Project list
============

Feel free to contact Gansheng TAN by email if you are interested in one of the following projects
- [ ] artificial blood, the goal is to find the red blood cell substitutes 
- [ ] biological and medical image restortion and reinforcement by minimizing the multi-layer graph-based energy function
- [ ] Language prouction research concerning ERP(Event-Related Potential), EEG or MEG(Magnetoencephalography). The main purpose is to create speech by using brain signals. (partly achieved thanks to AI)
- [X] Relevant feature engineering for EEG signals during meditation

Philosophy
==========
Gansheng TAN believes that
- One can always make his or her current decision the best one when he or she review it in the future.
- The imperfait memory and learning ability is the best resource of motivation.

Other activities
================
Gansheng TAN is doing a social projet **Tandem** which aims to provide a platform and give those of commun interest or seeking a new skill an oppotunity to help each other. Gansheng also do an teaching assistantship on *Analysis, probability and Partial Differential Equation* at CentraleSupelec.Gansheng Tan also contributed to R-packages such as *eeglab* and *eegkits*. <br><br>
Gansheng TAN is an amateur musician, he played guitar when he started the high school, and he praticed trombone when he was in [La band'à joe](http://www.bandajoe.com/?page=accueil_accueil).
