Gansheng TAN is a techinicien at [INSERM U1028](https://sfrsantelyonest.univ-lyon1.fr/centre51-inserm-u1028-cnrs-umr5292.html) as well as a research scientist in [L2S: Laboratoire des signaux et syst√®me](http://www.l2s.centralesupelec.fr/) whose research spans a cross-section of engineering, data science, and neuroscience. 

Academic Research
=================
Gansheng TAN is creative and ingenious, with high sense of responsability. He showed great interest in information domain and was rewarded second place of national computer performing competition when he was at high-school. He received his B.S. from [ShangHai Jiao Tong University](http://en.sjtu.edu.cn/) and became engineering student at [Centrale Paris](https://www.centralesupelec.fr/). During first two years in mechanical department of ShangHai Jiao Tong University, Gansheng has evaluated water film flow on large vertical and inclined flat plate of the passive containment cooling system (PCCS). In the field of machine learning and information, he has contributed to the creation of the website [La Condamine](https://lacondamine.org/), the CANs(Creative Adversarial Networks) as well as several information propagation models. Currently Gansheng worked on the analysis of EEG(Electroencephalography) signal during meditation focusing on several fields such as **personal artifacts detection** and **relaxation degree classification**.
