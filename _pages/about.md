Gansheng TAN is a PhD candidate in Biomedical Engineering, Washington University in St. Louis. He conducted master's research in Institude of Robotic, Shanghai Jiao Tong University where he worked on the application of brain complexity and cortico-muscular connectivy on stroke patients. He was a engineer at [INSERM U1028 Centre de Recherche en Neurosciences de Lyon](https://sfrsantelyonest.univ-lyon1.fr/centre51-inserm-u1028-cnrs-umr5292.html) as well as a research fellow in [L2S: Laboratoire des signaux et système](http://www.l2s.centralesupelec.fr/) whose research spans a cross-section of engineering, data science, and neuroscience. 

Academic Research
=================
Gansheng TAN's research is driven by a profound interest in dissecting the complex neural circuits that underpin human cognition, with a focus on electrophysiological mechanisms. Synthesizing principles from neuroscience, engineering, and computational modeling, he seeks to develop closed-loop neuromodulation technologies that improve the quality of life for people living with neurological conditions. To achieve this, Gansheng's work spans the basic neuroscience of human cognition, as well as the development and clinical validation of neurotechnology (both hardware and software).  He received his B.S. from [ShangHai Jiao Tong University](http://en.sjtu.edu.cn/) and graduate-level engineering degree at [Centrale Paris](https://www.centralesupelec.fr/). During first two years in mechanical department of ShangHai Jiao Tong University, Gansheng has evaluated water film flow on large vertical and inclined flat plate of the passive containment cooling system (PCCS). In the field of machine learning and information, he has contributed to the creation of the website [La Condamine](https://lacondamine.org/), the CANs(Creative Adversarial Networks) as well as several information propagation models. Gansheng worked on the analysis of EEG(Electroencephalography) signal during meditation focusing on several fields such as **personal artifacts detection** and **relaxation degree classification** since 2018. He came up with semi-automatic EEG preprocessing pipeline that is widely used by reseach teams in INSERM. Gansheng Tan earned a Master's degree in mechnical engineerinig  in Robotic Institute of Shanghai Jiao Tong University, and currently deal with graph-based functional analysis of multi-channels EEG-EMG signals and its application in sport performance assessment as well as stroke rehabilittion.

Project list
============

Feel free to contact Gansheng TAN by email if you are interested in one of the following projects
- [ ] Automomic and objective localization of Stereoelectroencephalography (sEEG) electrodes and deep brain stimulation electrodes based on MRI and CT.
- [ ] Development of wearable non-invasive vagus nerve stimulation and sensory stimulation for improving cognition

Philosophy
==========
Gansheng TAN believes that
- Every decision is the best when reviewing the life trajectory in the future.
- The imperfait memory and learning ability is the best resource of motivation.
- Memory is key to understand the universe.

Other activities
================
Believing an open exchange of ideas accelerates scientific progress towards solving our most persistent problems. Gansheng TAN participate in a science project **Open Science**, the goal of which is to promote a open science platform (*COS*)[https://cos.io/] and a new publishing register pipeline. Gansheng TAN is contributing on open-source software for electrophysiology data acquition, data analytics, statistical models, and brain computer interface. <br><br>



Gansheng TAN has initiated a social projet **Tandem** which aims to provide a platform and give those of commun interest or seeking a new skill an oppotunity to help each other. Gansheng was an instructor on *Analysis, probability and Partial Differential Equation* at CentraleSupelec. Gansheng Tan also contributed to R-packages such as *eeglab* and *eegkits*. <br><br>
Gansheng TAN plays guitar and drums when he started the high school, and he praticed trombone when he was in [La band'à joe](http://www.bandajoe.com/?page=accueil_accueil). He created a band *Aegean without sea* at CentraleSupélec and had several performing at school festivial and at Univercité Paris Sud. 

Gansheng TAN plays basketball for SJTU, and is a fan of rock climbing, hiking, and tennis.
